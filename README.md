**Semester: Fall 2019**

## Description 
This git repo contains all source code for three projects developed within a computer architecture course.
The following are the project files are present in the repo: 
1. pa1
2. pa2
3. pa4

Each project folder has its own README within the folder for descriptions. Each file with a *.c* ending tag indicates implementation by the author. 
For example, within the second folder of pa1: 
```
second.c
```
contains all implementations for the solution of the problems 

Various structures are used within the implementation, including, but not limited to: 
- Linked Lists
- File I/O from various sources
- Boolean Shifters

All projects within the repo are implemented on the Geany interface and in the C language. Codes are tested using a Virtual Machine running the Linux OS.

**Note**
Another assignment, pa3, is not uploaded onto the repo. The assignment deals with the decoding of a pattern in the assembly language. An assigment description will be posted shortly for this project
